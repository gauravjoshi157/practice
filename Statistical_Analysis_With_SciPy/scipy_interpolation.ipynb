    "## What is Interpolation?\n",
    "Interpolation is a method for generating points between given points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: for points 1 and 2, we may interpolate and find points 1.33 and 1.66.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolation has many usage, in Machine Learning we often deal with missing data in a dataset, interpolation is often used to substitute those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method of filling values is called imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from imputation, interpolation is often used where we need to smooth the discrete points in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Implement it in SciPy?\n",
    "SciPy provides us with a module called `scipy.interpolate` which has many functions to deal with interpolation:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1D Interpolation\n",
    "The function `interp1d() `is used to interpolate a distribution with 1 variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes x and y points and returns a callable function that can be called with new x and returns corresponding y."
